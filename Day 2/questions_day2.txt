Fundamental Network Topics

You can do most of the exercises in this document by yourself, but they are meant as exercises with a supplementary discussion in the class, so you will gain a lot more from participating in the class.
Understanding Basic Network Terms like IP, TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP and more.
Most of these exercises are meant to be answered with text, so write down your reply so you will remember.

What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?
176.20.48.88, found it on ip4.me. it shows the public ip that my router is using for computers on its local network.

What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?
192.168.56.1(home) found it by ipconfig in cmd, router gave me this address

What’s special about these address ranges?
 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 - det er max-min range for et 24-bit block system. hostid(24 bits) og mask bits(8).16.777.000 number of addresses
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 - max-min for 20 bit block system, med kun 1 million addresses.
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 - max-min for et 16-bit block system. kun 65000 addresser.


What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?
Localhost , altså ens egen computer. brugt til at oprette ip-forbindelser til ens egen computer.


What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443?
22	Yes, and SCTP[11]	Assigned	Official	Secure Shell (SSH),[10] secure logins, file transfers (scp, sftp) and port forwarding
23	Yes	Assigned	Official	Telnet protocol—unencrypted text communications[10][23]
25	Yes	Assigned	Official	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),[10][24] used for email routing between mail servers

port 80 : is http

port 443 is https

What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?
[165.227.137.75] i used tracert studypoints.dk

If you write https://studypoints.dk in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?
it uses dns which basicly maps ips to readable names using databases.

Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both
ip adress is who and where, the port is how to get there.

What is your (nearest) DNS server,?
fec0:0:0:ffff::1%1 (primary)
fec0:0:0:ffff::2%1
fec0:0:0:ffff::3%1


What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?
basicly like a phonebook for the internet. it assigns names to numbers.imagine you could just write a 
name into you phone and it would call the person with that name. thats what dns does on the web.

What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?
ipconfig told me 10.0.0.1


What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?

 DHCP Server . . . . . . . . . . . : 10.0.0.1 found it by ipconfig /all


Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack

kan være i flere lag
appilication- specific to the particular type og application
transport - oversees end-to-end transfer of data and can use multiple data streams.
internetwork - addressing and routing functions that ensure messages are delivered.
link - provides interface with underlying network hardware.

Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)
HTTP er en protokol der beder en server på TCP-port 80 (med mindre andet er angivet) om specifikke ressourcer.
Serveren svarer med HTTP-protokolkode for at angive det overordnede resultat af anmodningen, 
og derefter typisk selve ressourcen (fx et HTML-dokument eller et billede) eller en fejlbesked.

Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)

gennem tcp kan applikationer oprette forbindelse til hinanden.
tcp benytter portnumre for at åbne datastrømme fra/til samme værtsmaskine(levering af datapakker mellem to værter).

Opening a connection in HTTP means initiating a connection in the underlying transport layer, usually this is TCP. 
With TCP the default port, for an HTTP server on a computer, is port 80
